# SwftUISourceControl  

**Project Description**  
SwftUISourceControl is an educational project designed to demonstrate proficiency in essential Git and GitHub commands and techniques. This project covers all key aspects of version control, from working with local repositories to collaborating with remote repositories and leveraging GitHub for team workflows effectively.  

**Project Goals**  
- **Understanding local and remote data storage**: Demonstrating repository setup, cloning, and branch management.  
- **Branch management**: Creating new branches (`newBranch`), performing merges (`merge`), rebasing (`rebase`), and cherry-picking commits (`cherry-pick`).  
- **Change management**: Using `commit`, staging changes (`stage`), and temporarily saving changes (`stash`).  
- **Data synchronization**: Pushing changes to remote repositories (`push`) and pulling the latest updates (`pull`).  
- **Creating pull requests**: Managing merge requests, reviews, and status checks.  
- **Adding rules and restrictions**: Configuring branch protection rules, controlling merges, restricting force pushes, and setting up status checks.  

**Key Features**  
1. **Practical Examples**: The project includes real-world scenarios for using Git commands, such as branch management, resolving conflicts, merging, and rolling back changes.  
2. **Branch Rules and Protections**: The project demonstrates how to set up branch protection rules and pull request workflows, including mandatory status checks and automatic reviews.  
3. **Collaborative Workflow**: Learn effective techniques for team collaboration, such as using pull requests to discuss and review changes.  

**Who Is This Project For?**  
SwftUISourceControl is ideal for beginner developers looking to gain confidence in using Git and GitHub, as well as anyone who wants to systematize their knowledge and learn to use version control tools more effectively.
